# Features
The basic stuff like any other Twitch bot out there but with additions;
- Chatty like chat, where you can open individual sub-chats of Viewers for easier access to their messages.
- Output data (as much as viable/usefull) to json/text files (possibly websocket) for use in dynamic html5 overlays.
- Multiple giveaway system with each their own settings and entry list for when one is not enough.
- Discord integration -> set the playing game to for example 'LIVE: {game set on Twitch}'.
- Gamewisp integration for non-partners or when the subbutton is not good enough.
- Ranks (best of two worlds, Deepbot and Ankhbot);
  - Viewer
  - Regular
  - VIP Bronze
  - VIP Silver
  - VIP Gold
- Import Points and Hours from Deepbot and Ankhbot and cleanup database;
  - Remove Viewers below x amount of points
  - Remove Viewers below x amount of hours
  - Remove Viewers longer than x days last seen
- What we can change on Twitch through API will most likely to get a spot, just to make things simple.
- Own alerts (in the end) where donations are handled through TwitchAlerts as we don't like swapping
